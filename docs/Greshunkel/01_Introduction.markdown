GRESHUNKEL is the super weird templating language built for 38-Moths. It was
originally built as a stand-alone static site generator, but now it's morphed
into several disparate implementations.

GRESHUNKEL uses the X-Box Live syntax, which is mostly just `xXx` sprinkled
everywhere, for funsies. A good place to view different syntax and implementation
details is on the [GREHSUNKEL page](http://38-moths.shithouse.tv/greshunkel.html) for 38-Moths.
Specific C-Level API details can be found on the Documentation page.
